# Research Work
This repository contains some of the code I implemented and experimented with while working as an RA on a project aimed at integrating deep learning techniques into the aquaculture industry. This is not an official implementation as the research is still ongoing. 

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The datasets used are created from scratch. The data is collected from fish reservoirs in mp4 format. Lenthy mp4 videos are then splitted into smaller videos which are further broken down into frames, experimenting with different fps. 

## Models
Different Deep Learning models are trained on the available data to find the most suitable model and enhance the classification accuarcy of fish feeding status.
